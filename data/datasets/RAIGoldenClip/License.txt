the courts of the Municipality of Rome in case of legal proceedings regarding these terms and
conditions):
1. You agree to use the Content exclusively for research, experimentation and development
within the scientific purposes of the aforementioned project. You agree that demonstrating
excerpts of the Content such as research illustrations or findings relevant to the Content at

(for example at trade fairs), is strictly subject to a request for authorization from RAI.
2. You agree not to distribute the Content to anyone outside the group or entity for which you
are responsible. In no event you are authorized to place any part of the Content on a publicly
accessible Internet site. You agree that any publication of the Content on a website accessible
